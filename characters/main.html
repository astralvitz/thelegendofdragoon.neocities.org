            <font size="2">Dart is the main character in Legend of Dragoon. He is a strong leader and has a fierce sense
              of justice.
              <br>At the beginning of the game, he is searching for the Black Monster who, 18 years ago, killed his
              parents. When he returns to a ransacked Seles and learns about Shana's kidnapping, his quest becomes much
              more involved then revenge.
              <br>In Hoax, a female warrior named Rose awakens his Red-Eye Dragoon Spirit, and gives him the ability to
              transform into the Red-Eye Dragoon.
              <br>As he travels across Endiness, he learns much about the Moon That Never Sets and the Black Monster,
              and more about the history of Endiness (as well as his own family) and how it is affecting his fate as a
              Dragoon.

                  <br>She meets Dart in the beginning of the game after she saves him from Feyrbrand, and follows him to
                  Hoax, where she reveals that he is one of the Dragoons from the Legend and teaches him the ways of the
                  Dragoons. She feels a special connection to the other characters, and therefore joins them in their
                  journey (even if she doesn't act like she really likes any of them...).

                          usually when she is around a Virage. She doesn't understand these powers and becomes flustered
                          when they appear.
                          <br>To Dart's reluctance, Shana joins him in his quest after he rescued her from Hellena
                          Prison. She is weak, however, and is constantly being hurt. After a trip through the Dragon's
                          Nest, Shana became poisoned. When Dart brought her the White-Silver Dragoon Spirit, she was
                          healed. It is then she became the White-Silver Dragoon.
                          <br>In Deningrad, Shana becomes terribly weak and her Dragoon Spirit leaves her, accepting
                          Miranda as the new White-Silver Dragoon.

      only rules Basil.
      <br>Albert is a gentle, wise man with a wide vocabulary and soft personality, and enjoys politics and books. He
      joins Dart after Lavitz was killed in Hellena, and this is when Albert also inherited the Jade Dragoon Spirit.
      King Albert considers Lavitz one of his best and most trusted friends, and it was Lavitz who also taught King
      Albert how to use the Javelin.
      <br>When Albert travels to Fletz, he falls in love with Princess Emille.

                <font size="2">Miranda is the First Sacred Sister of Mille Seseau and a loyal servant to Queen Theresea.
                  She is a tough-talking girl with a sad past. She was abandoned by her mother when she was young, and
                  soon after her father died. She ran away to Deningrad to preach about love, but wound up fighting. She
                  was then adopted by Queen Theresea and became the First Sacred Sister.
                  <br>Miranda inherited the White-Silver Dragoon spirit after Shana became too weak to control it.
                  Miranda does not get along well with Rose, and they are constantly fighting. She is very much always
                  an angry person, but has a strong loyalty to her closest friends.

                    <font size="2">Lloyd starts out in the game as the Hooded Man and is the one behind Shana's
                      kidnapping, Lavitz' death, and the stealing of the Divine Moon objects, which he is using to
                      create his utopia. Dart and company will be chasing Lloyd for most of the game.
                      <br>Lloyd is strong and dangerous, carrying with him the Dragon Buster, a sword made by the
                      ancient Winglies used specifically for killing dragons and Dragoons. Though he joins the party
                      temporarily about halfway through the game (after he is defeated in Fort Flanvel), he is not a
                      playable character. (Too bad...)
                      <br>However, as bad as he may seem, he appears to have a special feeling towards Wink, the Third
                      Sacred Sister of Mille Seseau. ;) (at least I like to think so...) And although he plays the "bad
                      guy" for most of the game, he DOES realize his faults, and tries to help the Dragoons at several
                      points afterwards.
